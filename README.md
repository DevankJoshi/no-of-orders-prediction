# 📦 Order Prediction Model

This repository contains a Python script to **predict the number of product orders** based on historical data. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze trends and forecast future demand.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The script `no_of_order_prediction.py` performs the following tasks:

- 📊 Loads and explores order-related data from `supplement.csv`
- 🔍 Preprocesses and engineers features
- 🧠 Trains a regression model to predict order quantities
- 📈 Evaluates model performance using standard metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)
- 💾 Optionally saves or visualizes predictions

This model can be integrated into inventory systems to improve stock planning and sales forecasting.
